    <h1>Cache Explanation</h1>
    <p>Browser cache is a place on the hard disk where the browser keeps downloaded elements/cookies of websites in case they needed to be displayed again. For exampl, the logo of a company must be displayed on every page. It downloaded to the cache so that when we return to the same page or go the company's other pages, the logo will have already been downloaded and will be displayed. This prevents the cookies from being downloaded over and over for every page. When you clear the cache, everything must be downloaded again. This allows the cookies to be downloaded fresh so that problems in the previous elements will not affect this "fresh" cache. It is a sort of a "refresh" for the webpage. Hence that is why it is necessary for to delete the cache so that the Mailchimp popup will appear again. The old form will be disposed when the cache is cleared and the new form will be downloaded again when the page is opened again.</p>
